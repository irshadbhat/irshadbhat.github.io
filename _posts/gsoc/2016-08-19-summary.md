It was a nice and fulfilling experience for me to work with [Libindic organization](https://github.com/libindic) under [GSoC 2016](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/). I thoroughly enjoyed the work and learned a lot in the process. I contributed towards the automatic script transliteration between scheduled languages of India including English. I am thankful to [Riyaz Ahmad Bhat](https://researchweb.iiit.ac.in/~riyaz.bhat/) and [Santhosh Thottingal](http://thottingal.in) for mentoring me through the programme. 

Given below are some important links regarding the work done during the GSoC programme.
