I feel privileged to have been given the opportunity to work for [Libindic organization](https://github.com/libindic) under the Google Summer of Code 2016. I would be contributing towards the automatic script transliteration between scheduled languages of India. For the project, I would be mentored by [Riyaz Ahmad Bhat](https://researchweb.iiit.ac.in/~riyaz.bhat/) and [Santhosh Thottingal](http://thottingal.in).

## Machine Transliteration

### Project Description
A thorough description of the project goals can be seen in the original proposal submitted to GSoC 2016. Here I will briefly list down our contribution towards machine transliteration module of Libindic.

* Indic to Indic Script Transliteration
* Indic to Roman Transliteration

### Approaches

* ***Rule Based***: Rule-based system has a major plus point in Indic-to-Indic transliterations because of a special property of Indic scripts that their phonemes are one-to-one aligned between their Unicode tables.
* ***Machine Learning (ML)***: A major benifit with ML for transliteration system is that one is not required to be a domain expert of all the languages.

### Challenges

* #### Rule Based

 * *Missing phonemes in Indic scripts*: The major concern with rule-based system for Indic-to-Indic transliteration is the missing phonemes in Indian languages. For example, in Tamil there are no characters for *d*, *dh*, *b*, *bh* etc. *d* is pronounced as *t*, *dh* as *th*, *b* and *bh* are pronounced as *p*. In Bengali there is no character for *v*, it is pronounced as *b*.
 * *Ambiguous Character Mapings*: For example, Tamil has the following ambiguous caharacters

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Tables</th>
      <th align="center">Are</th>
      <th align="right">Cool</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>col 3 is</td>
      <td align="center">right-aligned</td>
      <td align="right">$1600</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>col 2 is</td>
      <td align="center">centered</td>
      <td align="right">$12</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>zebra stripes</td>
      <td align="center">are neat</td>
      <td align="right">$1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>item1</li>
          <li>item2</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
      <td align="center">See the list</td>
      <td align="right">from the first column</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

    | Character |     Maps to      | 
    |  :---:    |      :---:       |
    |   k       | k, kh, g, gh, h  |
    |   ch      | ch, chh, j, jh, s|
    |   T       | T, Th, D, Dh     |
    |   t       | t, th, d, dh     |
    |   p       | p, ph, b, bh     |


### During Community Bonding
