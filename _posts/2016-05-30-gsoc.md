I feel privileged to have been given the opportunity to work for [Libindic organization](https://github.com/libindic) under the Google Summer of Code 2016. I would be contributing towards the automatic script transliteration between scheduled languages of India. For the project, I would be mentored by [Riyaz Ahmad Bhat](https://researchweb.iiit.ac.in/~riyaz.bhat/) and [Santhosh Thottingal](http://thottingal.in).

# Machine Transliteration

## Project Description
A thorough description of the project goals can be seen in the original proposal submitted to GSoC 2016. Here I will briefly list down our contribution towards machine transliteration module of Libindic.

* Indic to Indic Script Transliteration
* Indic to Roman Transliteration

## Approaches

### Rule Based

A transliteration rule-based system uses the character mappings between the two scripts. There are four types of character mappings in natural languages: *One-to-One*, *One-to-Many*, *Many-to-One* and *One-to-None*. Higher ratio of *One-to-One* mappings against the other three leads to a more accurate and easy to develop system. 

* #### Benefits
 * Rule-based system has a major plus point in Indic-to-Indic transliterations due of a special property of Indic scripts that their phonemes are one-to-one aligned between their Unicode tables.

* #### Challenges
 * ***Missing phonemes in Indic scripts***: The major concern with rule-based system for Indic-to-Indic transliteration is the missing phonemes in Indic scripts. For example, in Tamil there are no characters for *d*, *dh*, *b*, *bh* etc. *d* is pronounced as *t*, *dh* as *th*, *b* and *bh* are pronounced as *p*. In Bengali there is no character for *v*, it is pronounced as *b*.
 * ***Ambiguous Character Mapings***: For example, Tamil has the following ambiguous caharacters


    | Character  |     Maps to       | 
    | ---------  |    ---------      |
    |    k       | k, kh, g, gh, h   |
    |    ch      | ch, chh, j, jh, s |
    |    T       | T, Th, D, Dh      |
    |    t       | t, th, d, dh      |
    |    p       | p, ph, b, bh      |

* ***Machine Learning (ML)***: A major benifit with ML for transliteration system is that one is not required to be a domain expert of all the languages.
