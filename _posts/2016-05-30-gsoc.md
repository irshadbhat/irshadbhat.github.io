I feel privileged to have been given the opportunity to work for [Libindic organization](https://github.com/libindic) under the Google Summer of Code 2016. I would be contributing towards the automatic script transliteration between scheduled languages of India. For the project, I would be mentored by [Riyaz Ahmad Bhat](https://researchweb.iiit.ac.in/~riyaz.bhat/) and [Santhosh Thottingal](http://thottingal.in).

## Machine Transliteration: Background and Project Description

### Goal
The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
