I feel privileged to have been given the opportunity to work for [Libindic organization](https://github.com/libindic) under the Google Summer of Code 2016. I would be contributing towards the automatic script transliteration between scheduled languages of India. For the project, I would be mentored by [Riyaz Ahmad Bhat](https://researchweb.iiit.ac.in/~riyaz.bhat/) and [Santhosh Thottingal](http://thottingal.in).

## Machine Transliteration

### Project Description
A thorough description of the project goals can be seen in the original proposal submitted to GSoC 2016. Here I will briefly list down our contribution towards machine transliteration module of Libindic.

* Indic to Indic Script Transliteration
* Indic to Roman Transliteration

### Approaches

* ***Rule Based***: Rule-based system has a major plus point in Indic-to-Indic transliterations because of a special property of Indic scripts that their phonemes are one-to-one aligned between their Unicode tables.
* ***Machine Learning (ML)***: A major benifit with ML for transliteration system is that one is not required to be a domain expert of all the languages.

### Challenges
* #### Rule Based

 * *Missing phonemes in Indic scripts*: The major concern with rule-based system for Indic-to-Indic transliteration is the missing phonemes in Indian languages. For example, in Tamil there are no characters for *d*, *dh*, *b*, *bh* etc. *d* is pronounced as *t*, *dh* as *th*, *b* and *bh* are pronounced as *p*. In Bengali there is no character for *v*, it is pronounced as *b*.
 * *Ambiguous Character Mapings*: For example, Tamil has the following ambiguous caharacters

    |Character  | Maps to          | 
    |---------- | -----------------|
    |k          | k, kh, g, gh, h  |
    |ch         | ch, chh, j, jh, s|
    |T          | T, Th, D, Dh     |
    |t          | t, th, d, dh     |
    |p          | p, ph, b, bh     |

### During Community Bonding

## Progress So Far
I will list down the progress on the project in three major blocks of time.

### Towards  Mid-term Evaluation
