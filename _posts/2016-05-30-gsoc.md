I feel privileged to have been given the opportunity to work for [Libindic organization](https://github.com/libindic) under the Google Summer of Code 2016. Libindic is an open source library that supports many utilities for text processing of Indian languages. I would be contributing towards the automatic script transliteration between scheduled languages of India. For the project, I would be mentored by [Riyaz Ahmad Bhat](https://researchweb.iiit.ac.in/~riyaz.bhat/) and [Santhosh Thottingal](http://thottingal.in).

# Machine Transliteration

## Project Description
A thorough description of the project goals can be seen in the original proposal submitted to GSoC 2016. Here I will briefly list down our contribution towards machine transliteration module of Libindic.

* Indic to Indic Script Transliteration
* Indic to Roman Transliteration

## Approaches

### Rule Based

A rule-based transliteration system uses character mappings defined between two scripts. There are four types of character mappings possible between two natural language scripts: *One-to-One*, *One-to-Many*, *Many-to-One* and *One-to-None*. A simple *One-to-One* character mapping would lead to a more accurate and easy to develop system. However, natural languages are inherently ambiguous. There are many cases of ambiguity in orthographic representation of languages world over. Distribution of different types of character mappings is not generally uniform, though. The distribution is usually skewed; unambiguous characters occur more often then their ambiguous counter parts. Nonetheless, to resolve the ambiguous mappings, heuristics are designed which take the surrounding context of an ambiguous letter into consideration.

* #### Benefits
 * Rule-based transliteration systems between Indic scripts is essentially trivial. Indic scripts have a special property that their phonemes are one-to-one aligned between their Unicode tables. It essentially means that the transliteration between any two Indic scripts can be achieved by merely using their unicode tables.

* #### Challenges
 * ***Missing phonemes in Indic scripts***: The major concern with rule-based system for Indic-to-Indic transliteration is the missing phonemes in Indic scripts. For example, in Tamil there are no characters for *d*, *dh*, *b*, *bh* etc. *d* is pronounced as *t*, *dh* as *th*, *b* and *bh* are pronounced as *p*. In Bengali there is no character for *v*, it is pronounced as *b*.
 * ***Ambiguous Character Mappings***: For example, Tamil has the following ambiguous characters

<table border="1">
<tr>
<th><b>&emsp;Character&emsp;</b></th> <th><b>&emsp;&emsp;Mapping&emsp;&emsp;</b></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>k</td> <td>k, kh, g, gh, h</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ch</td> <td>ch, chh, j, jh, s</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>T</td> <td>T, Th, D, Dh</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>t</td> <td>t, th, d, dh</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>p</td> <td>p, ph, b, bh</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>

* ***Machine Learning (ML)***: A major benefit with ML for transliteration system is that one is not required to be a domain expert of all the languages.

## During Community Bonding
