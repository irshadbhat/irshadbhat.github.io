I feel privileged to have been given the opportunity to work for [Libindic organization](https://github.com/libindic) under the Google Summer of Code 2016. I would be contributing towards the automatic script transliteration between scheduled languages of India. For the project, I would be mentored by [Riyaz Ahmad Bhat](https://researchweb.iiit.ac.in/~riyaz.bhat/) and [Santhosh Thottingal](http://thottingal.in).

# Machine Transliteration

## Project Description
A thorough description of the project goals can be seen in the original proposal submitted to GSoC 2016. Here I will briefly list down our contribution towards machine transliteration module of Libindic.

* Indic to Indic Script Transliteration
* Indic to Roman Transliteration

## Approaches

### Rule Based

A rule-based transliteration system uses character mappings defined between two scripts. There are four types of character mappings possible between two natural languages: *One-to-One*, *One-to-Many*, *Many-to-One* and *One-to-None*. *One-to-One* mappings would lead to a more accurate and easy to develop system. However, natural languages are inherently ambiguous. The distribution of ambiguous characters may be skewed, nonetheless present. To resolve the ambiguous mappings, heuristics are designed which take the surrounding context of an ambiguous letter into consideration.


* #### Benefits
 * Rule-based transliteration systems between Indic scripts is essentially trivial. Indic scripts have a special property that their phonemes are one-to-one aligned between their Unicode tables. 

* #### Challenges
 * ***Missing phonemes in Indic scripts***: The major concern with rule-based system for Indic-to-Indic transliteration is the missing phonemes in Indic scripts. For example, in Tamil there are no characters for *d*, *dh*, *b*, *bh* etc. *d* is pronounced as *t*, *dh* as *th*, *b* and *bh* are pronounced as *p*. In Bengali there is no character for *v*, it is pronounced as *b*.
 * ***Ambiguous Character Mappings***: For example, Tamil has the following ambiguous characters


    | Character  |     Maps to       | 
    | ---------  |    ---------      |
    |    k       | k, kh, g, gh, h   |
    |    ch      | ch, chh, j, jh, s |
    |    T       | T, Th, D, Dh      |
    |    t       | t, th, d, dh      |
    |    p       | p, ph, b, bh      |

* ***Machine Learning (ML)***: A major benefit with ML for transliteration system is that one is not required to be a domain expert of all the languages.
