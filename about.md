Hi! I am an MS-CSE student at the Language Technology Research Centre, International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, India. I work in the area of natural language processing (NLP). I am particularly interested in machine learning for processing and understanding natural language text. 

I joined IIIT-H in December 2014. I work as a Research Assistant in ILMT project. I am advised by Dr. Manish Shrivastav.
