Hi! I am an `MS-CSE` student at the `Language Technology Research Centre`, `International Institute of Information Technology`, Hyderabad, India. I work in the area of natural language processing (NLP). I am particularly interested in machine learning for processing and understanding of natural language text. 

I joined `IIIT-H` in December 2014. I work as a Research Assistant in `ILMT` project. I am advised by `Dr. Manish Shrivastav`.
